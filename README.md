# GUI_Calculator  
This program was made with a single purpose: to make an accessible calculator that can be used by those with impaired vision or eyesight.  
This application has two modes: standart and accessible  

## Standart  
Functions like a normal calculator, respects the order of operations and calculates in-line for readability  
  
## Accessible  
All the features of the standart mode are preserved and two more are added:  
1. When hovering over a button, the user can right-click on it and its contents will be spoken out loud  
2. When the user presses the **equals sign**, the answer will be read out loud  

## Installation Steps
Extract the **bin** folder in its entirety onto your machine, navigate to **calculator.exe** and launch the application. Enjoy!

## Source Code
The source code of the program can be found in the **src** folder, with the **main** located in the **Intro** class  

## Important Note
The program is currently under development, so many of the buttons on the calculator do not function.  
Those that do include:  
- numbers 0-9
- addition, subtraction, division, multiplication, dot, and equals
- square root and x^y
- open and closed brackets
- clear and delete buttons

All other buttons will be unresponsive when pressed, due to be fixed later
